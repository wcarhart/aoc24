# Advent of Code 2024
These are my solutions for Advent of Code 2024 (maybe I'll actually finish this year!)

To test with a local test file `test.txt`, use:
```
node app.js test <DAY> test.txt
```

To run a single day, use:
```
node app.js run <DAY>
```

To run multiple days, like days 1 through 5, use:
```
node app.js run {1..5}
```

To start a new day, use:
```
node app.js start <DAY>
```

Need help?
```
node app.js -h
```
